This repository demonstrates a subtle TypeScript type error that may not always be caught during compilation. The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers, but the code calls it with a number and a string. While strict type checking would ideally flag this, it can be missed, leading to runtime errors and unexpected NaN values. The solution shows how to correctly type check and handle such situations, ensuring type safety and preventing unexpected behavior.
